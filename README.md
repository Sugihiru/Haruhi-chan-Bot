# Haruhi-chan-Bot
A simple Discord bot for small servers filled with otakus


# Dependencies
Before using the bot, you should install the Python packages needed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Note that it may fail to install `mysqlclient` on Linux, in which case you should install the following dependencies on your system : `python3-dev`, `libmysqlclient-dev`


# Discord requirements
The bot must have the `Manage Roles` permissions. In later versions, a OAuth2 link will be provided to set directly the required roles for the bot.
